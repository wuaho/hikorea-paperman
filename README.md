# HiKorea Paperman

This project aims to enhance the user experience of the [HiKorea immigration portal](https://www.hikorea.go.kr/Main.pt) forms. The goal is to provide an interactive flow where users are asked what they need, and then guided through relevant questions, avoiding long and static forms. As users progress, they fill in only the necessary information.

### Tech Stack:
- Vite ‚ö°Ô∏è
- React ‚öõÔ∏è

### Features:
- **Dynamic flows**: Users select what they need, and the system adjusts the questions in real-time.
